Like most of us, I fear death.

Since I was around 3 years old, I know death exists and it scares the shit out of me.
Around my journey of trying to understand how to cope with the fact I'm going to die and my loved ones too, I made some
tought experiments. The first tought I had that made death more comforting is that we are all made of molecules, and I am
already just matter, part of a reaction that has been there since big bang. Let's say I die by an explosion so intense
that all of my cells are separated individually. I experience no consciousness and my body is no more. I would be dead.
For all humans and other animals cells die and some new ones are created, we don't have the same cells than when we were
kids. If I lose just one cell, I am not dead. 2 cells? I am not dead. What about 3? 4? 5...? The answer is still no. But
all of my cells would mean yes. More specifically all of my brain cells, that are also dying and reproducing with mitosis.

Here's a tought experiment:
What if I would make a robot cell that would act like a normal cells. If I replace one of my cells with that robot cells,
I am still alive, just with a robot cell somewhere in my body, we wouldn't even notice. Make that one cell becoming a
couple and then I am a cyborg. Still alive though. What if these cells are brain cells? I would still be capable of tought
if they are identical to my real biological cells. What if I change the entire cells of my body for these robot cells?
Then I would be dead? Or would I just be a robot? Or would the concept of me as an individual just become irrelevant? I 
don't know actually. But my interpretation would be that I am still me, probably. Would I still have a soul? 

What if I take all of the cells that quitted my body and assemble them together, making me again? Would that still be me?
Who is me? both?
